# 👋 Hi there, I'm Rupinder Bhatty
### 💡 About Me  
A programmer with a strong foundation in backend Java technologies and a growing passion about technical writing. With years of hands-on experience in Java-based tools and frameworks, I bring deep technical insight and a problem-solving mindset to everything I do.
As I transition into the field of technical writing, I’m focused on creating clear, user-friendly documentation, tutorials, and content that bridge the gap between complex technical concepts and real-world understanding. I have worked across mulitple domains like Ecommerce, airline tickets, location based mapping systems.
I'm a fast learner, thrive in new environments, and enjoy turning technical knowledge into accessible, impactful content.
