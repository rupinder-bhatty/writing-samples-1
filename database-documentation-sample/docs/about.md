# SQL Query Samples

This repository provides a collection of SQL query samples designed to demonstrate various SQL concepts and functionalities. The queries are based on a simple e-commerce database schema and cover fundamental operations, joins, aggregate functions, and more complex queries using subqueries, CTEs, and window functions.

This project is ideal for:

*   **Learning SQL:** Beginners can explore common SQL patterns.
*   **Practicing SQL:** Users can test and modify the queries.
*   **Demonstrating Skills:** A great resource to showcase SQL proficiency on your GitHub profile.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To use these samples, you'll need a SQL database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite). The provided queries are generally standard SQL, but minor syntax adjustments might be necessary depending on your specific database.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sql-query-samples.git
    cd sql-query-samples
    ```

2.  **Create the Database Schema and Insert Data:**
    The `data/sample_data.sql` file contains the `CREATE TABLE` statements to set up the database schema and `INSERT` statements to populate it with sample data.
    Execute this file in your SQL client or command-line tool to prepare your database.

    ```sql
    -- Example for MySQL/PostgreSQL using a command-line client
    mysql -u your_user -p your_database < data/sample_data.sql
    psql -U your_user -d your_database -f data/sample_data.sql
    ```
    (Adjust the command based on your specific database system and setup)

3.  **Explore the Queries:**
    Navigate through the `queries/` directory to find different categories of SQL queries. Each file focuses on a specific aspect of SQL.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

*   **`data/`**: Contains the SQL script to set up the database schema and insert sample data.
    *   `sample_data.sql`: Defines tables (`Customers`, `Products`, `Orders`, `Order_Items`) and populates them with sample records.
*   **`queries/`**: Contains various SQL query files, categorized by complexity and type.
    *   `basic_queries.sql`: Fundamental `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `IS NULL` statements.
    *   `join_queries.sql`: Demonstrations of `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and multiple table joins.
    *   `aggregate_queries.sql`: Usage of `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`.
    *   `complex_queries.sql`: Examples of `Subqueries`, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), `Window Functions`, and `CASE` statements.

## 📊 Database Schema

The sample queries operate on a simple e-commerce database with the following tables:

*   **`Customers`**:
    *   `customer_id` (PK)
    *   `first_name`
    *   `last_name`
    *   `email`
    *   `registration_date`

*   **`Products`**:
    *   `product_id` (PK)
    *   `product_name`
    *   `category`
    *   `price`
    *   `stock_quantity`

*   **`Orders`**:
    *   `order_id` (PK)
    *   `customer_id` (FK to `Customers`)
    *   `order_date`
    *   `total_amount`

*   **`Order_Items`**:
    *   `order_item_id` (PK)
    *   `order_id` (FK to `Orders`)
    *   `product_id` (FK to `Products`)
    *   `quantity`
    *   `price_per_unit`
