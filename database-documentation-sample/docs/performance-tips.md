# Performance Tips for Databases

- **Use Indexes** on frequently searched columns (e.g., `email`, `order_date`).
- Avoid using `SELECT *` â€” only select required columns.
- Normalize data but denormalize selectively for heavy-read workloads.
- Use proper data types for storage efficiency.
- Analyze query plans to identify bottlenecks.
