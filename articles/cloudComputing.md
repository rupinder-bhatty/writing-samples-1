# What is cloud computing? A beginner-friendly guide

### Introduction

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet (”cloud”). It enables users to access these resources on demand, typically on a pay-as-you-go basis, eliminating the need for businesses to manage their physical infrastructure. Companies of all sizes, from start-ups to large enterprises, are adopting cloud computing.

### Core Concepts

So what exactly is a “cloud”? **Definition**

A cloud is a group of servers in data centres all over the world, interconnected over the internet, and providing services to clients. By using cloud servers, customers do not have to manage these on their own. They typically pay for the services they have used. The main participants are the **cloud service provider** and the **cloud users**.

### How does cloud computing work?

In cloud computing, the storage and computing take place in a data centre, and users access these files and data from any device using the **internet**. For example, services like Gmail or Yahoo Mail can be accessed on any internet-enabled device. This benefits businesses as they no longer have to maintain the physical servers and applications.

### Main services models

**SaaS** - software as a service, as the name implies, users use the software over the internet/cloud, rather than having it installed on their machines locally, eg, Salesforce, Mailchimp

**PaaS** - platform as a service, this includes a complete platform, like infrastructure, hosted applications and operating systems. eg Microsoft Azure.

**IaaS** - infrastructure as a service. In this, users rent the storage and servers from the provider. eg AWS, Google Cloud Platform or OpenStack

### Different types of cloud

**Private cloud** - it’s a data centre dedicated to a particular organisation, generally large organisations. This data centre is managed by the respective organisation and accessible to its authorised users only.

**Public cloud -** This is a data centre owned and managed by a service provider. Users sign up and use these services according to their business needs. E.g., Microsoft Azure.

**Hybrid cloud** - This is a combination of both private and public clouds. For example, a company might store sensitive data on its private cloud while using a public cloud for running applications.

### Benefits of cloud computing

**Cost savings**

It saves cost by lowering operational costs.

**Agility**

On-demand and pay-as-you-go services offer flexibility as business needs evolve.

**Business continuity**

Service providers ensure data is backed up and distributed across their data servers so that businesses can operate smoothly, even during disruptions.

*Cloud computing has transformed the way businesses operate, offering flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scalability. Whether you're a student, professional, or business owner, understanding cloud basics is essential in today's tech-driven world.*
