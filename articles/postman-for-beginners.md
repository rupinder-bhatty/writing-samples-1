### What is Postman?

Postman is an important tool for modern-day API development. Postman is a platform for developing, testing and modifying APIs. It offers a user-friendly user interface to easily create, send and test the HTTP/S requests and responses.

Postman also provides collaboration and documentation tools, enabling teams to work together more efficiently and communicate API behaviour effectively

# **Key features of Postman**

# **1. API Designing**

Postman provides a powerful visual editor.  It helps you design APIs with ease and efficiency. With its intuitive user interface, you can create API endpoints and set their parameters, request, and response payloads, and authentication settings. The visual editor also allows you to document your API with clear and concise descriptions, making it easy for other developers to understand and use your API.

# **2. API Debugging**

Postman offers pre and post-request scripts that allow you to customize your requests and automate certain tasks. Pre-request scripts can be used to set dynamic variables, headers, and parameters, while post-request scripts can be used to perform actions based on the response of the API. With these scripts, you can streamline your workflow and quickly identify and fix any issues with your API.

# **3. API Testing**

Postman provides a comprehensive set of features to help you test your API and ensure that it meets the required standards. With automated testing, you can easily set up continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows, allowing you to test your API at every stage of development.

It also provides a range of testing tools, including unit tests, integration tests, and load tests, to ensure that your API performs as expected under various conditions. With these tools, you can ensure that your API is reliable, secure, and scalable.
